    "asterism": "A well-known pattern of stars that isn't an official constellation (but may be part of one), such as the big & little dippers and the teapot in Sagittarius",
    "deep sky": "Basically any celestial object outside of our solar system",
    "cepheid variable": "A class of stars discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908 which pulse at a frequency proportional to their absolute brightness, used to measure large distances by comparing their pulsation frequency to their observed brightness",
    "emission nebula": "A cloud of gas emitting light of certain wavelength due to quantum behavior. Normally hydrogen, ionized by a nearby star that formed from the same gas",

    "dither": "A technique to reduce noise due to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_filter_array'>color filter arrays</a> and electronic interference from the camera, accomplished by moving the frame slightly between exposures",

    "polar align": "Faint objects or details require long exposure times, but in order for those exposures to not just be streaky blurs, a mount capable of counteracting earth's rotation is needed. Polar alignment is the sensitive process of pointing that mount in the exact right direction to be able to do its job properly.",
