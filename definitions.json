    "cepheid variable": "A class of stars discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908 which pulse at a frequency proportional to their absolute brightness, used to measure large distances by comparing their pulsation frequency to their observed brightness",
    "hii region": "A cloud of glowing hydrogen gas ionized by UV radiation, usually coming from a young massive star which formed from regions of that same hydrogen",

    "hydrogen alpha": "The 656nm wavelength (deep red) light emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from its third energy level to its second",
    "ha": "The 656nm wavelength (deep red) light emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom falls from its third energy level to its second",
    "stellar death": "A star is considered dead when there is no more nuclear fusion occurring in its core, even if what remains may still radiate heat or light through other means",
    "light year": "A unit of distance which measures the distance light travels in a year, approximately equal to 6 trillion miles",
    "planetary nebula": "The outer layers of a dead low-mass star, cast out into unique structures and made to glow by the radiation of the white dwarf left at its center",

    "binning": "A camera combining square regions of adjacent pixels into one \"super pixel\" on a hardware level, which trades away higher resolution in order to reduce read noise. \"Binning X\" means each super pixel is X by X true pixels",
    "dither": "A technique to reduce noise due to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_filter_array'>color filter arrays</a> and electronic interference from the camera, accomplished by moving the frame slightly between exposures",

    "stacking": "A post-processing technique which averages several exposures into one artificially long one to produce a cleaner image than would otherwise be possible",
    "polar align": "Faint objects or details require long exposure times, but in order for those exposures to not just be streaky blurs, a mount capable of counteracting earth's rotation is needed. Polar alignment is the sensitive process of pointing that mount in the exact right direction to be able to do its job properly.",
    "imaging train": "Every optical element used to capture the image, including the telescope, the camera, and any filters or lenses in use",
