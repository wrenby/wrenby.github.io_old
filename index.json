[{"categories":null,"contents":"What to do with a planetary imaging train after the planets are out of sight? My main camera was out of commission, so I had to make due with the setup I was using: a high-magnification lens paired a camera with very small pixels, on an unguided mount that I never bothered to accurately polar align . Not ideal for dimmer targets, but I figured since the camera I was using had low read noise , I could just take a few hundred or thousand short exposures and still get something useful through the noise.","date":"2023-02-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2023-02-16-m97-owl-neb/","tags":["deep-sky","nebula","planetary-nebula","messier-object"],"title":"M 97, The Owl Nebula"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Believe it or not, full moons are generally considered bad news for astrophotographers. Faint details in a target can easily be swamped in the strong glow of the moon, especially when considered in tandem with artificial light pollution, and seasoned lunar photographers tend to prefer the high-contrast view of shadows cast by craters. But, to my good luck, I am not a seasoned lunar photographer, and am just as impressed a full moon as the rest of the world.","date":"2022-10-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-10-11-moon-mosaic/","tags":["solar-system","moon"],"title":"Full Moon Mosaic"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My first successful attempt at planetary photography! It\u0026rsquo;s not about to win an APOD, but basically no part of my equipment is well-suited for planetary work except this camera, so I\u0026rsquo;m extremely happy with the amount of detail that\u0026rsquo;s visible.

My name is Wren, and I\u0026rsquo;m a Pittsburgh-native amateur astrophotographer. Nights of Wren is a personal site I\u0026rsquo;m creating as a platform to share my photos with others. My interest mostly lies deep-sky astrophotography, which means I mostly take pictures of very distant things light-years away as opposed to planets or other things in the solar system. The category of deep-sky objects includes a wide variety: ancient clusters of stars in orbit around the Milky Way, glowing oceans of turbulent star-forming hydrogen, remnants of dead or dying stars, galaxies far far away, and more.","date":"2022-07-30T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Approximately 245 million lightyears in the direction of the constellation Andromeda, The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M 31 and NGC 224, formerly the Great Spiral Nebula in Andromeda) is our closest neighboring galaxy of similar size, and is projected to merge with the Milky Way in 4-5 billion years.
