My main camera was out of commission, so I had to make due with the setup I was using: a high-magnification lens paired a camera with very small pixels, on an unguided mount that I never bothered to accurately \u003cspan class=\"term\" data-term=polar\u0026#32;align\u003epolar align\u003c/span\u003e.

When I arrived, I decided to push my luck, since the 5-second exposures I used to find my way over looked very sharp, and managed to push all the way to 60 seconds with most of the frames still coming out looking good, which allowed for the resolution of fainter details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is it?\u003c/strong\u003e M 97 is a planetary nebula, a glowing cloud of ionized elements which previously made up the outer layers of a recently-dead average-sized star. A planetary nebula is essentially the equivalent of a supernova for stars which don\u0026rsquo;t have enough mass. Although this particular example is rather spherical and symmetrical in shape, planetary nebulae come in a surprisingly wide variety of shapes, with new research suggesting this variation is caused by the same mechanism which shapes its \u003cspan class=\"term\" data-term=stellar\u0026#32;wind\u003estellar winds\u003c/span\u003e in its prior stage of evolution, possibly gravitational interaction with large planets or \u003cspan class=\"term\" data-term=brown\u0026#32;dwarf\u003ebrown dwarfs\u003c/span\u003e in its orbit.\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb1229\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e M 97 was discovered by Pierre Méchain on February 16, 1781 \u0026ndash; meaning this image was, by sheer coincidence, taken precisely on the 242nd anniversary of its discovery.
