      <description>Believe it or not, full moons are generally considered bad news for astrophotographers. Faint details in a target can easily be swamped in the strong glow of the moon, especially when considered in tandem with artificial light pollution, and seasoned lunar photographers tend to prefer the high-contrast view of shadows cast by craters. But, to my good luck, I am not a seasoned lunar photographer, and am just as impressed a full moon as the rest of the world.</description>

      <title>Total Lunar Eclipse</title>

      <description>During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears red due to the way the light interacts with Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. Since the Earth is blocking direct sunlight, the only light it can receive has been refracted through the atmosphere, and the photons most likely to survive the trip are those with longer wavelengths: red light. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh Scattering, and it&amp;rsquo;s also responsible for the color of sunsets and the sky during the day.</description>

      <title>Warmup Moonshot</title>

      <description>Back before I had my trusty electronic focuser or the 3D-printed Bahtinov mask I used before that, I used to warm up with some quick pictures of the moon to verify that I was in-focus, and that my telescope mount could find its targets with reasonable accuracy. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been happy with how this one turned out, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d upload it as a mini behind the scenes.
