      <description>The Eastern Veil Nebula (also known as C 33, NGC 6992, and Ced 182b) is part of a large emissive supernova remnant called the Cygnus Loop. The Cygnus Loop in its entirety is estimated be around 10 to 20 thousand years old, 2670 lightyears away from Earth, and 120 lightyears across. The Eastern Veil is a portion of this larger nebula that emits relatively bright light in visible wavelengths due to high concentrations of oxygen, sulphur, and hydrogen. It gets its wispy appearance from shock fronts caused by the initial explosion.
Captured over two nights using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6&amp;quot; F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a stack of 6.6 hours total integration time distributed over 265 exposures at 1000 ISO. The second night was calibrated with 40 biases, flats, and darks, but the first night only had flats because I forgot do take any biases or darks. I was using a pretty aggressive dither though, so it worked out well enough ðŸ¤·</description>
