      <description>My first successful attempt at planetary photography! This was a tough job for my equipment, since my telescope is designed to be good at efficiently capturing long exposures of large dim objects like diffuse nebulae and not high-resolution millisecond-scale exposures of small bright objects. That said, I get a kick out of using my equipment wrong, and I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with the amount of detail that&amp;rsquo;s visible. The Great Red Spot remains impressive even through a monochrome camera depriving it of its signature color.
This final image is a sharpened stack of the best 90% of 10,000 frames of video spanning about two minutes. Captured using a ZWO ASI120MM Mini and a GSO 6&amp;quot; F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with AutoStakkert!3 and Registax 6.</description>
