      <description>What to do with a planetary imaging train after the planets are out of sight? My main camera was out of commission, so I had to make due with the setup I was using: a high-magnification lens paired a camera with very small pixels, on an unguided mount that I never bothered to accurately polar align. Not ideal for dimmer targets, but I figured since the camera I was using had low read noise, I could just take a few hundred or thousand short exposures and still get something useful through the noise.</description>

      <title>M 31, The Andromeda Galaxy</title>

      <description>Approximately 245 million lightyears in the direction of the constellation Andromeda, The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M 31 and NGC 224, formerly the Great Spiral Nebula in Andromeda) is our closest neighboring galaxy of similar size, and is projected to merge with the Milky Way in 4-5 billion years. The Andromeda Galaxy played an important role in The Great Debate concerning the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies &amp;ndash; then called spiral nebulae or island universes, depending on your side of the argument.</description>

      <title>M 27, The Dumbbell Nebula</title>

      <description>The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as M 27, NGC 6853, PK 060-03.1, and The Apple Core Nebula) is a vibrant funeral display of a star estimated to have died around 10,000 years ago. What remains is a white dwarf, surrounded by a glowing cloud of gas that made up its outer layers as a red giant. The Dumbbell Nebula was discovered in 1764, and was the first of its kind to be found.</description>

      <title>M 51, The Whirlpool Galaxy</title>

      <description>Discovered in 1773 by Charles Messier, M 51 is a famous pair of interacting galaxies approximately 28 million light-years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Canes Venatici.[1] The larger M 51a was discovered in 1773 by Charles Messier, and its companion dwarf galaxy M 51b was discovered by his friend Pierre MÃ©chain in 1781. The Whirlpool Galaxy is the first deep-sky object to be described as having a spiral structure, sketched by Lord Rosse in 1845.</description>

      <title>M 13, Hercules Globular Cluster</title>

      <description>Discovered in 1714 by Edmond Halley of comet fame, M 13 is one of about 160 known globular clusters orbiting the Milky Way[1] &amp;ndash; dense clusters of upwards of several hundred thousand stars that orbit around a host galaxy. Their origins are not well-understood since most of them are on the order of 10 billion years old, but they may be a halfway step between an open star cluster and a compact galaxy.</description>

      <title>M 101, The Pinwheel Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-03-29-m101-pinwheel-gal/</link>

      <description>The Pinwheel Galaxy is a face-on spiral galaxy found just off the handle of the Big Dipper. It is around 21 million light-years away[1], and has a diameter of around 170,000 light-years. It is notable for its high concentration of HII regions: clouds of ionized hydrogen gas glowing a deep red due to the same mechanism that makes certain materials glow under a black light. Unfortunately my camera at the time was not very sensitive to the specific wavelength of light generated by these clouds so they appear more white, but the largest and brightest of them are nonetheless annotated.</description>

      <title>M 42, The Orion Nebula</title>

      <description>If you were to ask someone on the street what they know about the constellation Orion, they&amp;rsquo;d probably just mention the belt and keep walking. But if that someone happened to be an astronomer, they might be more inclined to start by talking about the Orion complex. The Orion complex is a vast network of interstellar gas and dust spanning the entire constellation, and home to the closest stellar nurseries to Earth.</description>
