      <description>What to do with a planetary imaging train after the planets are out of sight? My main camera was out of commission, so I had to make due with the setup I was using: a high-magnification lens paired a camera with very small pixels, on an unguided mount that I never bothered to accurately polar align . Not ideal for dimmer targets, but I figured since the camera I was using had low read noise , I could just take a few hundred or thousand short exposures and still get something useful through the noise.</description>

      <description>Approximately 245 million lightyears in the direction of the constellation Andromeda, The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M 31 and NGC 224, formerly the Great Spiral Nebula in Andromeda) is our closest neighboring galaxy of similar size, and is projected to merge with the Milky Way in 4-5 billion years. The Andromeda Galaxy played an important role in The Great Debate concerning the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies &amp;ndash; then called spiral nebulae or island universes, depending on your side of the argument.</description>

      <description>The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as M 27, NGC 6853, PK 060-03.1, and The Apple Core Nebula) is a vibrant funeral display of a star estimated to have died around 10,000 years ago. What remains is a white dwarf, surrounded by a glowing cloud of gas that made up its outer layers as a red giant. The Dumbbell Nebula was discovered in 1764, and was the first of its kind to be found.</description>
